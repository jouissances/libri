# Libri

This gem scrapes the Barnes & Noble website (https://www.barnesandnoble.com/) and provides a CLI for viewing various book awards, the respective shortlisted books, as well as details about each book.

## Installation

You can install this gem via `gem install libri` on your terminal. 

## Usage

After installation, run the gem in your CLI by executing `libri`. Make sure to have installed all the required gems beforehand (pry, nokogiri, and open-air) by running `bundle install`, otherwise the command would return error.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
